# 🚀 Back to Code | My Comeback Journey

## 👋 Hello, I'm Nandhakumar
I am a passionate **Java Full Stack Developer (Fresher)** who loves building projects using  
**Java | Spring Boot | MySQL | Angular | Tailwind CSS | DSA (Java)**.

---

## ⏸ Why I Took a 60-Day Break
I joined **HVF (Heavy Vehicles Factory) as an apprentice**, and during that time:
✅ I learned discipline  
✅ I improved communication & confidence  
✅ I understood the importance of consistency  

But I was not able to practice coding during these 60 days, and I started to feel my skills getting rusty.

---

## 🔥 Why I'm Back
Now I’m **fully committed** to restarting my coding journey with even **more focus, energy, and clarity**.

💡 I believe:  
> “A short break doesn’t define me. My comeback will.”
